# feature_selection_for_regression
This script defines the input and output data, and then uses a trial-and-error approach to select the best features for the MLP regression model. It uses the combinations function from the itertools module to generate all possible combinations of features, and then trains and evaluates an MLP regression model on each combination using 10-fold cross-validation. The best combination of features is selected based on the lowest mean squared error (MSE) on the test data, and the selected features and the corresponding MSE are printed to the console.
